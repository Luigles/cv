    <hr>
   <p>After graduating in conservation biology I worked for a marine conservation organisation, where I conducted research on whale and dolphin migratory patterns, I also spent some time monitoring and analyzing data on great white shark behavior along the southern coast of South Africa. During this time I found a deep love for working with international students interning and volunteering abroad while facilitated their research projects and work experience. I then left South Africa for a four-year journey to South Korea where I worked as an English teacher to fund my travels around the world. I joined iXperience soon after moving back to Cape Town, South Africa where I now assist teams accross the company with any tech related stuff. Through My own experiences abroad, I strongly believe in the crucial role that well-crafted foreign experiences can play in helping students achieve their goals and be successful. When I'm not working, I like to spend my time coordinating animal rescue initiatives, building my own (often very buggy) video games and travelling! I also strongly believe that board meetings are code for surfing.</p>
